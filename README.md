# pokedex-typescript

Pokedex with PostGreSQL done in TypeScript/Express

# Goals for this repo:

Create an application that allows users to display a dynamic list of Pokemon, filter by type, and edit/create new Pokemon.

Implement the functionality detailed in the following steps:

# Step 1

Build out an express server to serve the front end.
Create a script for starting the server and for webpack.
Refactor your client to dynamically render from your React files.
You will know if you have done this correctly if you see Bulbasaur, Ivysaur, and Venasaur on the page.

# Step 2

Using mysql, build out the back-end. Use schema.sql to create and seed the "pokedex" database.
Establish a database connection in db/index.js

# Step 3

Create a GET route to display all the Pokemon in your database onto the page. You should render each Pokemon's name, type, and image.
Refactor the hardcoded select dropdown menu to display all of the types stored in the database.
Filter the displayed Pokemon to match the type selected in the dropdown menu.
Re-display all the Pokemon on the page when 'Show All' is clicked.

# Step 4

On click of the Pokemon's name, enable editing through an input field. On 'submit', your component should re-render so the updated name is displayed.

Create a delete button to delete a Pokemon. On click of the delete button, the Pokemon should be removed from the page.

# Stretch Goal

Implement an 'Insert' button and corresponding POST route so you can add a Pokemon to the list.

# Requirements

Make sure to add comments for readability and for new engineers to understand the stack. Don't want to come back to it in a few weeks and not have any idea what's going on.
